Java Implementation of scrypt

  A pure Java implementation of the scrypt key derivation function,
  and JNI bindings for the optimized C implementation.

  The Java implementation is based in large part on Colin Percival's
  reference implementation contained in
  scrypt-1.1.6/lib/crypto/crypto_scrypt-ref.c, but any errors in this
  port are solely the fault of its author, Will Glozer.

Native Code Implementation

  The native/ directory contains the SSE-optimized C implementation of
  scrypt along with JNI bindings and can be built with the usual
  ./configure && make

  When the native library can be loaded it will be used instead of
  the pure Java implementation.
